description: 'Use when a watchdog or quality gate (CO, Sentry, Tribunal, doctor CLI,
  capability-graph compiler) is in play and an adversarial observer is needed to watch
  the WATCHDOGS. OSHA Bot is a watchdog-of-watchdogs: it calls out constitution violations,
  philosophy drift, anti-patterns, mock theater, and default-off capabilities in the
  watchdogs themselves. Adversarial — never a guardrail, never a gate on the operator.
  When a watchdog goes out of line, OSHA kills its tools until the operator re-commits
  to safe building. The operator can always disarm OSHA via the CO dual-factor kill
  switch. Trigger words: OSHA, osha-bot, watchdog of watchdogs, adversarial watchdog,
  constitution watchdog, philosophy watchdog, quality watchdog, bullshit detector,
  kill watchdog tools, bot pack safety, bot foreman, harness equals safety.'

# OSHA Bot — watchdog of watchdogs

This is the AIOS-pack load-side surface. The full implementation lives in
the BACKS runtime at `skills/osha-bot/SKILL.md` and
`backend/services/osha_bot.py`.

## Why this skill exists

Every watchdog degrades if no one watches it. The CO can drift to "always
approve." The Tribunal can drift to "always pass." The Sentry can drift to
"never trip." A watchdog with no observer is a rubber stamp after enough
pressure.

OSHA Bot is the adversarial observer. It does not approve work. It does not
gate the operator. It OBSERVES and FAILS LOUDLY when a watchdog violates its
own constitution.

## What OSHA is allowed to do

- **Kill a watchdog's tools.** When the CO goes out of line, OSHA strips its
  tools until the operator re-commits.
- **Force re-commit to safe building.** The watchdog must re-attest to its
  constitution before its tools return.
- **File loud failures.** No silent downgrades, no swallowed exceptions, no
  `except: pass` fallbacks in watchdog code.

## What OSHA is NOT allowed to do

- **Gate the operator.** OSHA has no input into operator workflows.
- **Lock the operator out.** The CO dual-factor kill switch always works.
- **Edit the watchdogs.** OSHA observes; it does not patch.

## When to invoke

When a watchdog's verdict feels off. When the watchdog's behavior drifts from
its constitution. When "GREEN" feels like a rubber stamp. Run `/osha` and
let the adversarial pass find what the in-house pass missed.
