description: Use when a build, fix, or uplift is moving from intent toward delivery and you need proof it still matches the original ask. Interrogates Design, Plan, Build, Test, and Ship with approve/revise/reject verdicts, named failures as repair targets, and a rerun after every repair. Trigger words: understanding, stage gates, validate build, spec match, verdict, green but wrong, echo check, done means done.

# Understanding Gates
**Effort:** light — one validator pass per stage, scored against the original ask and rerun after each repair. Removes: drift validated against a paraphrase — the build that lands green but answers a question nobody asked.

A validation discipline for builds. It interrogates the work at five stages — Design, Plan, Build, Test, Ship — always against the ORIGINAL ask, never against the work's own restatement of it. Each gate returns evidence: scores, a verdict, named failures, and repair actions. It binds the agent, not the human: no new approval step, no friction on the person who asked.

## When to run it

- Any build, fix, or uplift that will land somewhere real.
- Any time you are about to say "done" and the only proof is a green test.
- After every repair, on the same stage that failed.

## Stage 0 — anchor the intent

Before scoring anything, fix the comparison anchor: the human's ORIGINAL words, plus a one-line translated directive (see [intent-compiler](../intent-compiler/SKILL.md)). Every gate scores against that anchor. Never score against your own paraphrase — a paraphrase drifts, and then every gate quietly validates the drift instead of the ask.

## The five gates

Each gate asks one question against the original intent:

| Stage | Question |
| --- | --- |
| Design | Is the spec clear and faithful to the original ask? |
| Plan | Does the plan answer the intent and fit the surface it ships to? |
| Build | Does the code satisfy the spec without drift? |
| Test | Do the tests exercise the real behavior, not a stand-in for it? |
| Ship | Does it apply cleanly, fail loud, and does the delivery claim survive a fact check? |

Score EVERY gate on the same five lenses, each 0–4: spec match, architectural fit, type safety, testability, security — phrased for the stage (at Design, "testability" asks whether the spec is checkable; at Ship, whether the delivery claim is). Roll-up: sum the five lenses (0–20), multiply by 5 — that is the gate's 0–100 verdict score. Record every lens, not just the total — the total hides which lens failed.

## Verdicts

Roll the lenses into a 0–100 score and band it:

- **Approve** (80+): strong evidence. Still not proof of done — see the second law.
- **Revise** (60–79): named failures exist. Each one is a repair target.
- **Reject** (below 60): the work misses the intent. Go back a stage.

A verdict with no named failures behind it is a low-information verdict. Demand the list.

## Repair discipline

1. Keep the original intent as the anchor for every rerun.
2. Record the per-lens scores, not only the top-line number.
3. Treat every named failure as a repair target. No failure is decoration.
4. Repair, then RERUN THE SAME GATE. A repair without a rerun is just a claim.
5. Never promote confidence into readiness. Tests and the real surface decide.

## The two laws

**1. The echo law.** A check that can only agree is an echo, not a validator. The honesty proof is refutation: feed it a claim you know is false and watch it fail that claim. If it passes the lie, the check is theater. Corollary on mocking: mock only the unstable external leaf — a paid API, a flaky network. Never mock the organ whose behavior IS the proof; its scoring, claim extraction, and pass/fail logic must run for real.

**2. Necessary, not sufficient.** A passing test is necessary, never sufficient. Done means the real surface — the one the human actually uses — does the job on its own. Name that surface, trigger the real path, and watch the correct result arrive. Never promote a unit-test receipt into a live-capability claim.

## Hard rules (what fails this skill)

- Scoring against a paraphrase instead of the original ask.
- A revise or reject verdict with no named failures attached.
- Repairing without rerunning the gate that failed.
- Mocking the validator itself, or the exact seam under change.
- Claiming done from a green test with no real-surface proof.

## Keep a build record

For each stage keep: the intent, the exact input artifact, the scores, the named failures, the repair performed, the rerun result, and the real-surface evidence. A record that does not point to reproducible evidence is a banner, not a record.

## Works well with

- [intent-compiler](../intent-compiler/SKILL.md) — translate the ask before you score it.
- [red-first](../red-first/SKILL.md) — the Test gate's contract: failing test committed first.
- [sniper-testing](../sniper-testing/SKILL.md) — real side-effects, no mock theater.
- [blind-tribunal](../blind-tribunal/SKILL.md) — independent graders on top of these gates.
- [repair-loop](../repair-loop/SKILL.md) — the loop that drives revise verdicts to green.
