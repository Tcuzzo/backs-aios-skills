# Clean Code Gauntlet

## Why this exists

Messy code makes agents thrash, and rules buried in a long prompt fade
mid-context — deterministic checks never fade. So run Clean Code as a
**gauntlet the code must pass**, not prose the model must remember.

**Measure, do not review.** Gate on numbers a tool computes: coverage,
cyclomatic complexity (a count of independent paths through a function), module
size, mutation kills. Humans and models audit samples — never whole diffs.

## The chain (run in order; each stage stops loud on failure)

1. **Sniper tests green.** Run only the test files covering what the diff
   touched — see [sniper-testing](../sniper-testing/SKILL.md). A red baseline
   means stop and fix; never mutate or grade on red.
2. **CRAP under threshold** on real coverage data (see the gate below).
   Breach → refactor the function down, or cover it fully. Never lower the bar.
3. **Mutation testing: zero survivors in scope.** A survivor convicts the
   TESTS, not the code — strengthen the test that should have caught it.
4. **Light taste review** — a model judges only what numbers cannot.

## Tools that compute this

| Stack | Tools |
| --- | --- |
| Python | coverage.py + radon + mutmut |
| JS/TS | c8 (or istanbul) + Stryker |
| Other | any coverage % + any cyclomatic-complexity counter |

One command shape per stage:
- Coverage: `coverage run -m pytest <sniper files> && coverage report` (JS/TS: `npx c8 vitest run <files>`)
- Complexity: `radon cc -s <changed files>`
- Mutation: `mutmut run --paths-to-mutate <changed files>` (JS/TS: `npx stryker run --mutate "<glob>"`)

## The CRAP gate

```
CRAP(m) = comp(m)^2 * (1 - cov(m)/100)^3 + comp(m)
```

- At 100% coverage the score collapses to the complexity itself.
- 30 is the classic "crappy" line (complexity 5 with zero coverage hits it).
- Humans hold roughly 4–5 complexity per function. An agent may carry 6–8
  ONLY at near-100% coverage — the coverage pays for the slack.
- A high-CRAP function has exactly two exits: refactor it down, or cover it
  fully. **Never lower the threshold to pass.**

## Whose debt is it — AUTHORED / WORSENED / UNCHANGED

An absolute score hides whose debt it is. Split every complexity and CRAP
delta against the pre-change baseline:

- **AUTHORED** — functions this change created. The full bar applies.
- **WORSENED** — pre-existing functions this change made worse. The delta is
  charged to this change; it must come back to baseline or better.
- **UNCHANGED** — pre-existing debt the change never touched. Report it, file
  it, never charge it to this change — and never use it as cover to skip
  the gauntlet.

## Mutation rules (bounded, never reckless)

- **Never the shared working tree.** Mutate in a scratch checkout cut from
  committed HEAD. Dirty target or test files = refuse; commit first.
- **Cost is measured, never assumed.** Time the scoped suite once, report
  ETA = baseline x mutant count BEFORE spending anything. Offer a dry run.
- **Bounded and resumable.** Cap mutants and minutes. A budget stop is a
  pause with a checkpoint, not a failure — resume to finish.
- **Coverage-first.** Mutate only covered lines; an uncovered line is a
  coverage gap the CRAP gate already caught.
- **Scoped only.** Mutate what the diff touched, never the whole repo.
- A genuinely equivalent mutant may be refuted instead of killed — with the
  refutation written down, never silently skipped.
- **No mutation tool exists for your stack?** Record that in the landing
  report and rely on the CRAP gate — never silently skip.

## The taste review (last, and light)

Deterministic gates go first; spend a model only where reasoning is the only
tool. The reviewer is a model from a different family than the builder — the
builder never grades its own work. It judges only design and taste: naming,
mixed concerns, interface width, and the six smells — rigidity, fragility,
immobility, needless complexity, needless repetition, opacity. The arithmetic
was already settled by the gates.

Craft floor the review holds: functions small, doing one thing, few arguments,
no flag arguments, honest names; deep modules — a small interface hiding real
logic; tests fast, independent, repeatable, one behavior asserted each.

## Hard rules (any one broken fails the skill)

- Never lower a threshold or weaken the mutation set to force a pass.
- Never mutate the shared working tree; never run unbounded.
- Never charge UNCHANGED debt to the current change.
- A test that cannot fail is theater — mutation testing is how you prove
  which tests are real.
- Say the real cost — machine time is cheap, regressions are not. Never
  fake green to save the hour.

## Works well with

- [sniper-testing](../sniper-testing/SKILL.md) — picks the test scope for stage 1
- [red-first](../red-first/SKILL.md) — the failing contract that precedes any build
- [blind-eval](../blind-eval/SKILL.md) — keep-or-revert when taste is the question
- [blind-tribunal](../blind-tribunal/SKILL.md) — a fuller graded verdict before landing
