description: Use when a session is ending, the context window is about to compact, or the work must continue in another agent or harness. Compacts the session into one flat file a brand-new agent can read cold and continue from — state, half-done work, exact next command, open decisions — with secrets redacted and concurrent work verified preserved. Trigger words: handoff, hand off, compact, save state, continue in another session, portable handoff, before restart.

# Session Handoff
**Effort:** free — one flat file written before the context dies; no model calls, and it cuts cost outright at the next session start. Removes: the fresh agent re-deriving state, re-paying traps already paid for, and decisions lost in a dead context window.

A context window dies; the work must not. Before a session ends or compacts,
write one flat file a brand-new agent can read cold and continue from — what
was being done, where it lives, what is half-done, and the exact next command.
A handoff parked in chat prose or memory alone does not exist.

## When to write one

- Before the context window compacts or is cleared.
- When ending a session with work still open.
- Right after landing something big (record the commit id while it is fresh).
- The moment a real decision goes to your human (record what each choice means).

## Where it goes

One known place the next agent will look FIRST. If the next agent shares your
project, use a stable ledger file in the repo and commit the update so it
survives a machine restart, not just a context clear. If the next agent is a
different harness or a fresh login, write a flat portable file to the temp
dir — it is scaffolding, not a tracked artifact.

## Verify concurrent work first (before writing a word)

Check that work from OTHER sessions is preserved. Run `git status`,
`git log`, and `git worktree list`. Note dirty files and unmerged branches in
the doc honestly. Never alter another session's uncommitted work to make the
handoff look clean — that is the data-loss defect. A handoff that describes a
clean state while another session has work in flight is a false claim.

## What goes in — one short section each

1. **Goal.** The work in one sentence. The next agent must not have to guess
   what "done" means.
2. **State.** Landed (commit ids), building, queued. Reference specs, plans,
   issues, and diffs by path or URL — never duplicate their content.
3. **Where the work lives.** Branches, worktrees, dirty files. Name the exact
   files the next agent must read first.
4. **The verdict trail.** Who or what graded each piece and what the real
   catches were. A failed verdict with named defects is MORE valuable than a
   green — write the defects verbatim.
5. **Half-done work and the exact next command.** What is mid-flight, and the
   literal command that continues it.
6. **Open decisions.** Anything waiting on your human, and what each choice
   means. A decision must never exist only in a dead context window.
7. **Unmet contracts.** Tests still red, proofs still missing, promises made
   but not yet kept.
8. **Traps.** One line each. A trap you already paid for is worth more than a
   green — write it so the next session does not pay again.
9. **Suggested skills.** Which skills the next agent should load first, and
   one line why. This is what makes the doc portable across harnesses.

## Hard rules

- **Redact.** No API keys, passwords, tokens, or personal data. No real
  hostnames, internal IPs, or home paths — placeholders only; point at real
  values by env var name. A handoff is the file most likely to leave the
  machine; a secret that leaks through it IS the bug.
- **Absence claims rot fastest.** Before writing "X does not exist" or "X is
  not landed," re-verify at the current commit — parallel work lands while
  you write.
- **Two-word status per item: PROVEN or STILL-BUILDING.** Green tests without
  live proof is STILL-BUILDING, and the handoff says exactly what proof is
  missing.
- **Keep it readable in two minutes** (about 120 lines). When it grows past
  that, archive the oldest blocks by moving them to a history section —
  never by deleting.

## Pickup (the other half)

A session that starts from a handoff reads it FIRST, then verifies the top two
or three claims against `git log` and the live tree before acting on them.
The handoff is a map, not truth — trust it for WHERE to look; verify WHAT it
says.

## Works well with

- [root-cause-first](../root-cause-first/SKILL.md) — the investigation the next session continues.
- [repair-loop](../repair-loop/SKILL.md) — hand off mid-loop without losing the seam.
- [decision-bar](../decision-bar/SKILL.md) — how open decisions reach your human.
- [repo-map](../repo-map/SKILL.md) — the durable repo index the next session reads first.
